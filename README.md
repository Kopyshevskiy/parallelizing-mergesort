# Parallel MergeSort in C++ with OpenMP

This repository contains the source code for a highly optimized, parallel implementation of the MergeSort algorithm, developed for the "Parallel Computing" course at Politecnico di Milano (2024-2025). The project focuses on leveraging multi-core processor capabilities using C++ and the OpenMP library to achieve significant speedup over a standard serial implementation.

## Project Goal

The primary objective was to parallelize the MergeSort algorithm to minimize its execution time on a modern multi-core laptop. The benchmark for performance was a serial implementation that sorted a ~380MB array in approximately 9.7 seconds.
